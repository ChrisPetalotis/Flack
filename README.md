The purpose of this project is to create a web chat application, that uses Web sockets to deliver messages to the intended user. My main goal here was to understand how to set up duplex communications between clients and transfer text messages on these connections.

The back-end of the application was built using Python, and the Flask framework. For the front-end, I used HTML and CSS.

Funtionality wise this project is fine. I intend to modify the UI in order for it to be nice to look at and more intuitive for the user to navigate.
